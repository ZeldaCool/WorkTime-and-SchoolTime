# WorkTime and SchoolTime
 Two GUI-Based Python Apps
 WorkTime contains a salary calculator and an itinerary maker.

 SchoolTime contains grade calculators and an itinerary maker.

 Release 1 3/25/25: This release includes a salary calculator using CLI. My next release will include the itinerary maker, still in CLI. I am planning to use matrices for that.
